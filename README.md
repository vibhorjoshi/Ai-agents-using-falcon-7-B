# Ai-agents-using-falcon-7-B


## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI agent using the Falcon-7B model for various NLP tasks. The system is designed to handle input queries, generate responses, and optimize outputs using advanced machine learning techniques. The project also integrates keyboard control for a bot in CoppeliaSim, allowing navigation, balance, and interaction with specific checkpoints and objects.

## 🚀 Features

- AI agent powered by Falcon-7B
- CoppeliaSim bot control (navigation, pick-and-place, balancing)
- Implementation of LQR/PID for stability
- Interaction with checkpoints and object manipulation
- Command-based execution with penalties and evaluation criteria

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- CoppeliaSim
- Required Python libraries

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent-falcon7B.git
cd ai-agent-falcon7B

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Project

### 1. Running the AI Agent

```bash
python ai_agent.py
```

### 2. Running the CoppeliaSim Bot Control

```bash
python bot_controller.py
```

### 3. Running the Pick-and-Place Task

```bash
python pick_place_task.py
```

## 🕹️ Usage Instructions

- **Navigation**: Use keyboard inputs to control the bot.
- **Pick-and-Place**: Follow task 2A guidelines to complete object manipulation.
- **Evaluation Rules**:
  - Penalties apply for incorrect balance.
  - Time limits for reaching checkpoints.
  - Score based on efficiency and precision.
